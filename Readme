Requirements
------------

	- Windows NT/2000/XP, Windows 95/98/SE/ME
	- A 200MHz processor or better for playing Bonk files
	- Winamp is required to play Bonk files in Windows
	- You'll need properly installed ASPI drivers for CD ripping.

	Additional requirements for compiling the sources:

		- MinGW v1.x or v3.2+ (http://www.mingw.org/) or MSVC v6.0
		- smooth v0.8.65.0 CVS (http://www.smooth-project.org/)
		- IOLib v5.x (http://www.iolib.org/ - included with smooth)

	Additional optional software:

		- BladeEnc is used if installed (http://bladeenc.mp3.no/)
		- TwinVQ is used if installed (http://www.twinvq.org/)
		- Winamp 2 input and output plug-ins are used if they are found in the plugins directory
		- MSLU is used if installed on Windows 9x/ME systems (http://www.microsoft.com/)

Known problems
--------------

	- There are the following restrictions on the input file format:

		- BladeEnc:
				- files must be at 32, 44.1 or 48kHz
		- LAME:
				- files must be at standard rates (8, 11.025, 12, 16, 22.05, 24, 32, 44.1, 48kHz)
		- TwinVQ:
				- files must be at 22.05kHz (24 and 32kBit) or 44.1kHz (48kBit)

	- Resampling is only supported with LAME. Input files must be at the desired output
	  sampling rate unless you are encoding with LAME.

	- The command line interface doesn't support options for modifying encoder settings, yet.

	- Arabic language support currently requires Windows XP or later.

Future plans
------------

	- Sheduled for v1.0
		* shell integration
		* local CDDB support
		* write online documentation for BonkEnc
		* clean CDDB code

	- Some later release
		* input filter for VQF
		* support more audio formats (FLAC, MAC, WMA, ...)
		* develop an IOLib-Filters based plugin system
		* add musicbrainz.org support
		* allow command line options to configure encoder settings

	- All time tasks
		* support more languages
		* cleanup the code
