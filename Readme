BonkEnc version 1.1

BonkEnc is an encoder for various audio formats. It can read
MP3, MP4/M4A, AAC, Ogg Vorbis, Bonk, FLAC, WAV, AIF, AU and VOC
files and produce MP3, MP4/M4A, AAC, Ogg Vorbis, Bonk, FLAC, VQF
and WAV files.

BonkEnc uses the CDRip Ripping Library for audio ripping.
BonkEnc uses the FAAD2 AAC decoder for Advanced Audio decoding.

Requirements
------------

	- Windows NT/2000/XP/Vista, Windows 95/98/SE/ME, Wine v0.9.14+
	- A 200MHz processor or better for playing Bonk files
	- Winamp is required to play Bonk files in Windows
	- Having ASPI drivers installed is recommended for CD ripping

	Additional requirements for compiling the sources:

		- MinGW v3.2+ (http://www.mingw.org/) or MSVC v8.0
		- smooth v0.8.70.0 (http://www.smooth-project.org/)

	Additional optional software:

		- The CDRip Ripping Library is used if installed (http://www.cdrip.org/)
		- BladeEnc is used if installed (http://bladeenc.mp3.no/)
		- TwinVQ is used if installed (http://www.twinvq.org/)
		- Winamp 2/5 input and output plug-ins are used if they are found in the plugins directory
		- MSLU is used if installed on Windows 9x/ME systems (http://www.microsoft.com/)

Known problems
--------------

	- There are the following restrictions on the input file format:

		- BladeEnc:
				- audio must be at 32, 44.1 or 48 kHz
		- FLAC:
				- the FLAC reference encoder is limited to a maximum sample resolution of 24 bit
		- LAME:
				- audio must be at standard rates (8, 11.025, 12, 16, 22.05, 24, 32, 44.1, 48 kHz),
				  can be converted by LAME
		- TwinVQ:
				- audio must be at 22.05 kHz (24 and 32 kBit) or 44.1 kHz (48 kBit)

	- Resampling is only supported with LAME. Input files must be at the desired output
	  sampling rate unless you are encoding with LAME.

	- BonkEnc is currently limited to a maximum of 2 audio channels

	- Edit boxes do not work correctly in Right-to-Left mode

	- The WMA input plug-ins of Winamp 5.22 and later are not compatible with BonkEnc. Use
	  the WMA plug-in of Winamp 5.21 if you need WMA input.
