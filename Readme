It supports audio CD ripping, tag editing and video downloads and converts
the following audio formats:

	- MP3
		- using the LAME MP3 encoder		(http://lame.sourceforge.net/)
		- using the mpg123 decoder		(http://www.mpg123.de/)
		- using the MAD MP3 decoder		(http://www.underbit.com/)

	- MP4/M4A AAC
		- using the FAAC/FAAD2 codec		(http://www.audiocoding.com/)

	- Windows Media Audio				(http://www.microsoft.com/)

	- Xiph Foundation codecs
		- Opus					(http://www.opus-codec.org/)
		- Vorbis				(http://www.vorbis.com/)
		- Speex					(http://www.speex.org/)
		- FLAC					(http://flac.sourceforge.net/)

	- Apple Lossless (ALAC)
		- using the libav ALAC encoder		(http://www.libav.org/)
		- using David Hammerton's ALAC decoder	(http://www.craz.net/)

	- Musepack					(http://www.musepack.net/)
	- WavPack					(http://www.wavpack.com/)
	- Monkey's Audio				(http://www.monkeysaudio.com/)

	- various other formats
		- using the libsndfile library		(http://www.mega-nerd.com/)
		- using the libav codec library		(http://www.libav.org/)

Further codecs (including Nero's HE-AAC encoder) can be used as external
plug-ins (see the manual for installation instructions).

fre:ac uses the CDRip library for audio ripping on Windows.
fre:ac uses the cdio library for audio ripping on Linux and NetBSD.
fre:ac uses the cdparanoia library for audio ripping on FreeBSD and OpenBSD.

Known problems
--------------

	All platforms:

		- There are the following restrictions on the input file format:

			- FLAC:
					- the FLAC reference encoder is limited to a maximum sample resolution of 24 bit
			- LAME:
					- audio must be at standard rates (8, 11.025, 12, 16, 22.05, 24, 32, 44.1, 48 kHz),
					  can be converted by LAME

		- Resampling is only supported with LAME. Input files must be at the desired output
		  sampling rate unless you are encoding with LAME.

		- fre:ac is currently limited to a maximum of 2 audio channels

	Windows specific problems:

		- There are the following restrictions on the input file format:

			- BladeEnc:
					- audio must be at 32, 44.1 or 48 kHz
			- TwinVQ:
					- audio must be at 22.05 kHz (24 and 32 kBit) or 44.1 kHz (48 kBit)

	Mac OS X specific problems:

		- Audio CD ripping does not work

	Solaris specific problems:

		- Audio CD ripping does not work

	Linux and Unix specific problems:

		- There are no application packages for fre:ac yet, so you need to install dependencies manually for now.
		  Please just extract the contents of the archive to your home directory.
