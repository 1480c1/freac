fre:ac version 1.1 CVS

fre:ac is a free and open source audio converter for various formats.
It reads MP3, MP4/M4A, AAC, Vorbis, Bonk, FLAC, WAVE, AIFF, AU and
VOC files and converts to MP3, MP4/M4A, AAC, Vorbis, Bonk, FLAC,
VQF or WAVE.

fre:ac uses the CDRip Ripping Library for audio ripping on Windows.
fre:ac uses the cdparanoia library for audio ripping on Linux and FreeBSD.
fre:ac uses the FAAD2 AAC decoder for Advanced Audio decoding.

	- Pentium 4 CPU, 128 MB RAM, 50 MB free disk space

	Additional requirements for compiling the sources:

		All platforms:

			- smooth v0.8.71.0 CVS (http://www.smooth-project.org/)

		Windows:

			- MinGW GCC v4.0+ (http://www.mingw.org/) or Microsoft Visual C++ v10.0

		All Linux and Unix platforms:

			- GCC v4.0+

			- libcairo, libmad, libogg, libfaac, libfaad2, libmp3lame, libmp4v2, libopus
			  libspeex, libvorbis, libjpeg, libpng, libbz2, libxml2, libxmu, libx11

			Linux:

				- GTK+, libasound2, libcdio

			Solaris:

				- audio headers

	Additional optional software:

		- On Windows, Winamp plug-ins can be used if they are present in the 'plugins' directory.

		- Several external codecs can be used with fre:ac. Please see the manual for more details.

Known problems
--------------

	All platforms:

		- There are the following restrictions on the input file format:

			- FLAC:
					- the FLAC reference encoder is limited to a maximum sample resolution of 24 bit
			- LAME:
					- audio must be at standard rates (8, 11.025, 12, 16, 22.05, 24, 32, 44.1, 48 kHz),
					  can be converted by LAME

		- Resampling is only supported with LAME. Input files must be at the desired output
		  sampling rate unless you are encoding with LAME.

		- fre:ac is currently limited to a maximum of 2 audio channels

	Windows specific problems:

		- There are the following restrictions on the input file format:

			- BladeEnc:
					- audio must be at 32, 44.1 or 48 kHz
			- TwinVQ:
					- audio must be at 22.05 kHz (24 and 32 kBit) or 44.1 kHz (48 kBit)

	Mac OS X specific problems:

		- File and directory selection dialogs initially appear behind the main window

		- No icons are displayed in message boxes

		- Audio CD ripping does not work

	Solaris specific problems:

		- Audio CD ripping does not work

	Linux and Unix specific problems:

		- There are no application packages for fre:ac yet, so you need to install dependencies manually for now.
		  Please just extract the contents of the archive to your home directory. Do not try to install it system wide.
