	- A 200MHz processor or better for playing BONK files
	- Winamp is required to play BONK files in Windows
	- You'll need properly installed ASPI drivers for CD ripping.

	Additional requirements for compiling the sources:

		- MinGW v1.x (http://www.mingw.org/) or MSVC v6.0
		- smooth v0.8.62.0 CVS (http://www.smooth-project.org/)
		- IOLib v5.x (http://www.iolib.org/ - included with smooth)

	Additional optional software:

		- FAAC is used if installed (http://www.audiocoding.com)
		- TwinVQ is used if installed (http://www.twinvq.org)
		- Winamp 2 Input Plugins are used if they are found in the plugins directory
		- MSLU is used if installed on Windows 9x/ME systems (http://www.microsoft.com)

Problems
--------

	- There are the following restrictions on the input file format:

		- BonkEnc:
				- files must be 16 bit
		- BladeEnc:
				- files must be 16 bit at 32, 44.1 or 48kHz
		- LAME:
				- files must be 16 bit at standard rates (8, 11.025, 12, 16, 22.05, 24, 32, 44.1, 48kHz)
		- Ogg Vorbis:
				- files must be 16 bit, stereo
		- FAAC:
				- files must be 16 bit, stereo
		- TwinVQ:
				- files must be 16 bit, at 22.05kHz (24 and 32kBit) or 44.1kHz (48kBit)

	- Resampling is only supported with LAME. Input files must be at the desired output
	  sampling rate unless you are encoding with LAME.

	- The command line interface doesn't support options for modifying encoder settings, yet.

Future plans
------------

	- extract artist and title from the filename
	- input filters for AAC, VQF
	- support more audio formats (FLAC, MAC, WMA, ...)
	- allow expert settings for LAME (ATH, Temporal Masking, Psy-Models)
	- develop an IOLib-Filters based plugin system
	- support more languages
	- cleanup the code
	- shell integration
	- add musicbrainz.org support
	- local CDDB support
	- allow command line options to configure encoder settings
	- write online documentation for BonkEnc
	- improve support for right-to-left scripts
	- add online update functionality
